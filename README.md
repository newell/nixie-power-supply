High Voltage Nixie Power Supply

This project is a fork of [Nick de Smith's high voltage nixie power supply](
http://desmith.net/NMdS/Electronics/NixiePSU.html) that converts his [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) design files to [pcb-rnd](http://repo.hu/projects/pcb-rnd/) and [gschem](http://wiki.geda-project.org/geda:gaf).

This is a high efficiency (typically 85%) 50mA, 150-220V, Nixie Power Supply.
